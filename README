Capistrano Notify
================

Capistrano-Notify is a framework to enable the sending of deploy notifications from capistrano to various sources.

It is intended to provide a framework to make it easy to extend for other sources.

Initially I intend to provide support for XMPP, Email and REST, however I also hope that others will get involved and provide additional plugins for services such as twitter, basecamp etc.
